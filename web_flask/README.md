# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web Framework

## Overview

The AirBnB clone project focuses on developing a web framework using Flask, a Python micro-framework, and Jinja, a templating engine. This framework allows developers to build web applications by defining routes, handling variables, and rendering HTML templates dynamically. By leveraging Flask and Jinja, developers can create dynamic web applications with ease.

## Concepts

-   **What is a Web Framework?**: A web framework is a software framework designed to simplify the process of building web applications by providing reusable components and tools.
-   **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework in Python. It provides tools, libraries, and patterns to build web applications quickly and efficiently.
-   **Jinja**: Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating engine for Python, inspired by Django's template engine. It allows developers to generate dynamic content by embedding Python-like expressions within HTML templates.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

-   Explain the concept of a web framework and its role in web development.
-   Build a web framework using Flask, including defining routes and handling variables.
-   Understand the concept of routes in Flask and how to define them to handle different URL endpoints.
-   Handle variables in routes to create dynamic content and responses.
-   Define templates using Jinja to generate HTML responses dynamically, including loops, conditions, and variable interpolation.
-   Display data from a MySQL database in HTML templates to create dynamic web pages.
